## 🧭 About This Project

We all have goals — but building habits that stick is hard.  
**Habit Tracker** is my small attempt to make that easier.  
It helps you create, track, and maintain daily habits in a simple and motivating way.  
Whether you’re trying to wake up early, study regularly, or just drink more water — this app keeps you on track.
